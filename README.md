# Abstract
This is a project for the data science professional certificate capstone from HarvardX institution
through the Edx platform and the objective is to construct a forecast the spread CoViD-19
through predictive models using updated time series worldwide data of reported cases for the
Novel CoronaVirus Disease (CoViD-19) from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) data repository(1). This report shows different methods
that forecast the spread of the virus. In the first section (Sec. I) describes the dataset and
variables, and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed. In the
second section (Sec. II) explains the process,techniques used, data cleaning, data exploration
and visualization. To model were used with R package fpp2. The third section (Sec. III) shows
the results presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance. And the last
section shows the conclusion that gives a brief summary of the report (Sec. IV).
